# Code 201: Add a form
Lab assignment for seattle-201d6

This project is based off of a demo of a Code 201 class project; originally built by Scott Schmidt.

## Instructions

Run and study this code to see how it works and what it does. What we want to do, in general, is add a form to the sales.html page so that data from the form is passed through the cookie stand constructor function and adds a new location to the table.

So, here's some of the steps you'll need to take, but not necessarily in this order:

* Add the necessary HTML to create the input form.
* Don't forget \<fieldset>!
* Use the constructor function as your guide to determine what input fields your form needs (hint: also consider what is passed in when creating instances!)
* Your JS will need an event listener and and event handler
* Are you going to do any error correction on input? You should.
* Build incrementally. Test frequently.
